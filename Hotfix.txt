Due to ongoing changes in the webtrees core code, the custom module 'Shared Places' is broken currently. 
You'll either have to disable it temporarily, or patch the webtrees core code by replacing a single file:

webtrees\app\Services\ModuleService.php

with the file:

webtrees\modules_v4\vesta_shared_places\hotfix\ModuleService.php

(this changes two lines of code, swapping the module initialization order. 
This allows custom module to affect the webtrees core code to a greater degree,
which is required for this module)



We're working on a permanent solution for this problem in the webtrees branch 'develop'.
